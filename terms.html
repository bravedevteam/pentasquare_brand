            <h4>12. Grievance Handling and Dispute Resolution</h4>
            <p>
              a) The Company shall inform Users on the Company’s website about the ways that Users can present their opinions or complaints regarding any inconveniences experienced by the Users. The Company operates as a dedicated organization to handle such Users’ opinions and complaints. This does not exclude your rights to bring any legal claim or complaint to a regulator outside of this process.<br>
              b) If a dispute arises between you and Company, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Accordingly, except where and to the extent prohibited by law, by using the Game or Services, you and the Company agree to the use of arbitration on an individual basis through a mutually agreed arbitrator selected with the consent of the Company and you, where a claim is for less than the equivalent of $10,000 US Dollars. ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE, AND YOU WAIVE, THE RIGHT FOR A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. Other rights that you and we would otherwise have in court will not be available or will be more limited in arbitration, including discovery and appeal rights. All such disputes shall be exclusively submitted to the chosen arbitrator for binding arbitration under the arbitrator’s rules then in effect, before one arbitrator to be mutually agreed upon by both parties. If a dispute arises between the Company and the User, the Company shall faithfully demonstrate the measures taken in respect of the User, including any restrictions of usage, and will comply with result of any arbitration decision.<br>
              c) The Company has the sole discretion on whether to, and to what extent to, but no obligation to, enforce any rights of Company or take any actions as stated in these Terms.

              Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that Company may have, you acknowledge and agree that compensation by way of damages alone would not be an adequate remedy for any breach of these Terms by you, because Company would suffer irreparable losses if you breach these Terms. Accordingly, you agree that Company shall be entitled to the remedies of an injunction, specific performance or any other equitable remedy, in addition to any other remedies available to it under the applicable law. For the avoidance of doubt, Company shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or any other equitable remedy without bond, other security or proof of losses.
